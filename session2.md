# Session 2: Sound Part Two

## Recap of Last Session
### Properties of Periodic Waves

 - Last session, we learned about basic periodic signals (sine, cosine)
 - We learned that they have **Phase, Frequency and Amplitude**
 
 - **Phase** (what point the wave is in its periodic cycle). This is often measured in degrees (`0-360`) or radians (`0 - 2*PI`), or also by a point in time if the frequency is known. With a sine waveform, 0 degrees is the start, 90 degrees is the postive peak, 180 degrees is when it returns to the centre line, 270 degrees is the negative peak, and 360 degrees is the start of the next cycle. When we reach 360 (`2*PI`), we can either begin from 0 again (i.e., we can 'wrap' the phase so it's always between 0 and 360), or we can continue to increase the phase. **Mathematical functions for creating waves generally take inputs in radians**. Therefore, a waveform's phase at any time can be described by its position in time (as in the above diagram), or in radians / degrees, or by its real value.
 
 - **Frequency** (how often they repeat their cycles). This is measured in Hertz (Hz), or CPS (cycles per second). Some people find this is a lot easier to think about than phase.
 - **Amplitude** (the *absolute peak* output, which for audio is between 1 and -1, the **maximum amount the speaker can move**), with a *node* when it *crosses zero*. By *absolute*, we mean with the sign removed, so -1 in that case can be thought of as 1 in absolute terms, despite needing to be considered as -1 for the purposes of representing the phase of the signal either side of 0.
 - *Both Amplitude and Frequency relate to Phase*
 - Amplitude is the highest value the signal can produce (at its peak - remember, it's an oscillation through positive and negative phase!)   
 - Frequency is how often the complete phase cycle repeats every second
 - The higher the frequency, the higher the perceived pitch
 - The higher the overall amplitude, the higher the perceived volume
 
 - **In addition, I provided you with some notes about how we record and represent these periodic signals in a computer. They mention the Nyquist rate, The Nyquist frequency, the sampling rate, and how this relates to the frequency response of the human hearing system. I also introduced the idea of data representation in the context of bit resolution, and how this relates to amplitude** 
 
 *Also* 
 ### Complex Interactions Generated by Periodic Waves
 - We learned how to add periodic signals together, how this can cause distortion, and also generate *beating*.
 - We learned how to multiply them together to create *Amplitude Modulation* **(AM)**, and how this creates *sum and difference tones*.
 - We learned how to use one periodic signal to control the frequency of another, and how how this creates *Frequency Modulation* **(FM)**
 - We also learned that we can create complexity by doing this; for example, increasing the **modulation index** of the modulating wave (i.e., its local amplitude) increases the number of overtones (without generating distortion, as the main output doesn't change - remember, we're only changing the frequency). We perceive this as an increase in *brightness*. Also, when the frequencies are factors or multiples of one another, or some other value, we get harmonic overtones (less beating **because the nodes are in phase**), and if they aren't, we get more beating (**because the nodes are out of phase**)
 - We tried to use basic waveforms to create a range of sounds that continually changed
 - We got a taste of the approach we need to do these things in JavaScript
 - We used variables, objects and basic functions. We also used basic operators (+, -, *, /)
 - Some of you might have come across some additional math objects (abs, exp, sin, cos). I definitely used one of these if you were paying attention.
 
 **Homework From Last Session**
 
 I asked you to make a sound composition by forking a document, creating some new oscillator objects (maxiOsc objects), and using them to control other maxiOsc objects :-)

## Homework Review
 - Lets review the homework :-) 
 - Then we're going to have a question and answer session about the example code you were given just to go over the basics.
 
# Session 2: SAMPLES!
 - We're going to explore how to load samples and manipulate them
 - We're also going to learn how to use the maxiClock object to schedule events. 
 - We will be using conditionals (if statements) to set the state of the program.
 - As a result, we should become clearer about the use of <,>,||,==,&&, and !.
 - We'll also be getting more familiar with using % (modulo)

## What is a sample?
- Last week we used the term 'sample' to describe an individual value, or number, between -1 and 1

 
 ## Example code for this session:
  - This basic drum machine example has everything you need in it

  - Here is a more developed example with the play-button code in it, and a more complex output:

# Exercise for this week
 - Create a soundscape or rhythmic piece that uses at least four sounds, and continually changes for over 2 minutes. 

# Additional Materials
 - Here's an advanced example that combines all the things we looked at in the last two weeks, as well as some other stuff
