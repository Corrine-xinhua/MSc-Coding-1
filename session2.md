# Session 2: Sound Part Two

## Recap
### Properties of Periodic Waves
 - We learned about basic periodic signals (sine, cosine)
 - We learned that they have **Phase, Frequency and Amplitude**
 
 - Phase (where they are in their cycle)
 - Frequency (how often they repeat their cycles)
 - Amplitude (the *peak* output, which for audio is between 1 and -1, the **maximum amount the speaker can move**), with a *node* inbetween at infinity (when it is at zero).
 - *Both Amplitude and Frequency relate to Phase*
 - Amplitude is the highest value the signal can produce (at its peak - remember, it's an oscillation through positive and negative phase!)   
 - Frequency is how often the complete phase cycle repeats every second
 - The higher the frequency, the higher the perceived pitch
 - The higher the overall amplitude, the higher the perceived volume
 
 **- In addition, I provided you with some notes about how we record and represent these periodic signals in a computer. They mention the Nyquist rate, The Nyquist frequency, the sampling rate, and how this relates to the frequency response of the human hearing system. I also introduced the idea of data representation in the context of bit resolution, and how this relates to amplitude** 
 
 *Also* 
 ### Complex Interactions Generated by Periodic Waves
 - We learned how to add periodic signals together, how this can cause distortion, and also generate beating.
 - We learned how to multiply them together to create amplitude modulation (AM), and how this creates sum and difference tones.
 - We learned how to use one periodic signal to control the frequency of another, and how how this creates frequency modulation (FM)
 - We also learned that we can create complexity by doing this; increasing the modulation index of the modulating wave (i.e., its amplitude) increases the number of overtones (without generating distortion!). We perceive this as an increase in brightness. Also, when the frequencies are factors or multiples of one another, or some other value, we get harmonic overtones (less beating **because the nodes are in phase**), and if they aren't, we get more beating (**because the nodes are out of phase**)
 - We tried to use basic waveforms to create a range of sounds that continually changed
 - We got a taste of the approach we need to do these things in JavaScript
 - We used variables, objects and basic functions. We also used basic operators (+, -, *, /)
 - Some of you might have come across some additional math objects (abs, exp, sin, cos). I definitely used one of these if you were paying attention.
 
 **Finally**
 
 I asked you to make a sound composition by forking a document, creating some new oscillator objects (maxiOsc objects), and using them to control other maxiOsc objects :-)

## First
 - Lets review the work that you have done in the last week. 
 - Then we're going to have a question and answer session about the example code you were given just to go over the basics.
 
# Session 2: SAMPLES!
 - We're going to explore how to load samples and manipulate them
 - We're also going to learn how to use the maxiClock object to schedule events. 
 - We will be using conditionals (if statements) to set the state of the program.
 - As a result, we should become clearer about the use of <,>,||,==,&&, and !.
 - We'll also be getting more familiar with using % (modulo)

## What is a sample?
- Last week we used the term sample

 
 ## Example code for this session:
  - This basic drum machine example has everything you need in it
  - https://mimicproject.com/code/9538f995-f184-8a64-967c-f5de93e58076
  - Here is a more developed example with the play-button code in it, and a more complex output:

# Exercise for this week
 - Create a soundscape or rhythmic piece that uses at least four sounds, and continually changes for over 2 minutes. 

# Additional Materials
 - Here's an advanced example that combines all the things we looked at in the last two weeks, as well as some other stuff
