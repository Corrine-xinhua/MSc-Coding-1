# Session 5: 3D graphics from scratch

## Part One : Recap
 - Last session we looked at more advanced 2D graphics concepts
 - We used expressions to create complex pixel manipulations
 - We also learned about how to do basic image processing
 - We looked at concepts such as convolution for edge detection, bluring, and other effects
 - We also thought about complex space a little, and looked at the mandelbrot set a bit

## Homework Review
 - Let's have a look at the work you have done in the last week. 
 - Do you have any questions about the task? What problems did you have?

# Part Two : 3D Graphics Systems From Scratch

This session will take us through how to create a basic 3D graphics engine using a simple 2D drawing context. You might have guessed a little how we might approach this, but by the end of this session you should have a much better idea of how a 3D graphics system produces images with a sense of depth and perspective.  

## Let's start at the very beginning.

- This is the very first 3D computer graphics sequence in any major movie.
- It was produced by the artists Larry Cuba. 
- Larry Cuba worked with John Whitney, and is a hugely important figure in experimental cinema *and* computer graphics
- Shout out to Larry in case he's reading :-) We love you.

## First Principles
- In order to draw a 3D scene, we need to create the illusion of depth.
- We do this by introducing the idea of a perspective *projection*
- What this means is, we take 3D coordinates, and we use a simple algorithm to determine 

## Part Three : 3D Graphics In Depth

- This lecture will explain core mathematics concepts that we need to consider when working in 3D.
- There's quite a lot to take in, so I've made a presentation
- These have details of all the work required with this weeks session
- They include example code, and full explanations of core 3D graphics concepts, including an introduction to matrix transformations.

## HOMEWORK
 - Start from the basic 3D perspective projection that we used.
 - Create an interactive geometry system using this basic engine.
 - Think about how you can adapt some of the knowledge you have learned in previous sessions
 - Also, consider how you might use distance as a factor.
